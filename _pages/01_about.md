Research Experience:
Autonomous Mobile Robot | (Current Research Topic)		                          Edwardsville, IL
●	Design and build six autonomous mobile robots use for research and courses at SIUE
●	Use Python to control the high-level controller: NVIDIA Jetson TX2 Development Kit
●	Execute C++ to control the low-level controller: Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3
●	Communication between two controllers: Serial Port
●	Robot Perceptions: 6 Ultrasonic Sensors, 4 Infrared Sensors, Encoders, Tracking Camera Intel RealSense T265
●	Control Design: Go to Goal, Odometry, Obstacle Avoidance, Trajectory Tracking, Path Following

Robotic Fish (B.E. Senior Project) | Dec. 2011 – Dec. 2013		                 Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam
●	Designed and built a robotic fish to be able to swim as well as a real fish
●	Worked extensively with microcontrollers, using C language, esp. PIC16F887
●	Developed and carried out testing

Dancing Robot Contest at HCMC UTE | Nov. 2012		                                 Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam
